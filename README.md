SRProgen
========

A tool that is based on PROGEN but adds spatial resource constraint, which enrichs the tool set in the field of project scheduling.

In the field of project scheduling, researchers need to test the algorithm that they design, which requires a lot of data. So far, several existing resource-constrained project scheduling problem generation tools only consider renewable resources, non-renewable resources, and the dual nature of resources, none of which consider spatial resources. 

Kolisch. et al designed a tool called PROGEN as project scheduling problem builder, and used this tool to generate a standard problem library PSPLIB, which is a great convenience for resource-constrained project scheduling problem. But it just considered three types of resources mentioned above. Research about spatial resource-constrained project scheduling problem also requires a lot of problem instances, but there is no corresponding problem generation tool. Therefore, We design a project scheduling problem generation tool containing spatial resources, which can generate resources mentioned above too. The tool is based on PROGEN, and code in JAVA called SRPROGEN.

You can get more information about this tool by refering to the paper of NICST2013 conference named "Model and Problem Generation Tool of Project Scheduling Problem with Spatial Resources".
