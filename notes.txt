  Kolisch. et al designed a tool called PROGEN as project scheduling problem builder, and used this tool to generate a standard problem library PSPLIB, which is a great convenience for resource-constrained project scheduling problem. But it just considered three types of resources: renewable, non-renewable and dual nature resources. Research about spatial resource-constrained project scheduling problem also requires a lot of problem instances, but there is no corresponding problem generation tool. So this tool is used to generate spatial resource-constrained project scheduling problem instances.
